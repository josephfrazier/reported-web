# Reported-Web

A web front-end for [Reported](https://twitter.com/Reported_NYC).

## Install

Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/) and [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/), then run the following:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/josephfrazier/Reported-Web reported-web
cd reported-web
yarn
cp .env.example .env
```

## Run

In one session, load variables from `.env` into your environment, then:

```bash
yarn mongo-start
yarn parse
```

In another session:

```bash
yarn start
```

Miscellaneous commands:

```bash
yarn dashboard # Runs a dashboard for the Parse server
yarn mongo-stop # Stops MongoDB
```

## Context on `localStorage` use (w.r.t performance concerns about lag/delay/slowness/latency when typing)

Over the years, reports of slow typing have come from multiple users, and it periodically gets (re)discussed in our Slack.
Since our Slack currently doesn't preserve old messages, I often find myself re-investigating the issue and re-typing previous responses.
This section is meant to provide more central and permanent documentation of these investigations.

For example: here's one of my posts from a conversation from July 2023 where this came up: https://reportedcab.slack.com/archives/C9VNM3DL4/p1690221553212389?thread_ts=1690137347.880569&cid=C9VNM3DL4

Responses from Justin:

> `(20) ['email', 'password', 'FirstName', 'LastName', 'Phone', 'testify',
> 'plate', 'licenseState', 'typeofcomplaint', 'reportDescription',
> 'can_be_shared_publicly', 'latitude', 'longitude', 'coordsAreInNyc',
> 'formatted_address', 'CreateDate', 'isAlprEnabled',
> 'isReverseGeocodingEnabled', 'isUserInfoOpen', 'isMapOpen']`

> The issue reappears shortly after clearing the local storage. Can it just be caused by hammering the save every 500ms? Or maybe the debounce is broken and its saving more often?

> as a test, after clearing local storage
> * login
> * type something in the description box
> * refresh
> * typing in description box is now laggy

This project is based on [React Starter Kit](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit). See its README below:

<details><summary>React Starter Kit README</summary>

## React Starter Kit — "[isomorphic](http://nerds.airbnb.com/isomorphic-javascript-future-web-apps/)" web app boilerplate &nbsp; <a href="https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/stargazers"><img src="https://img.shields.io/github/stars/kriasoft/react-starter-kit.svg?style=social&label=Star&maxAge=3600" height="20"></a> <a href="https://twitter.com/ReactStarter"><img src="https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/ReactStarter.svg?style=social&label=Follow&maxAge=3600" height="20"></a>

[React Starter Kit](https://www.reactstarterkit.com) is an opinionated boilerplate for web
development built on top of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/),
[Express](http://expressjs.com/), [GraphQL](http://graphql.org/) and
[React](https://facebook.github.io/react/), containing modern web development
tools such as [Webpack](http://webpack.github.io/), [Babel](http://babeljs.io/)
and [Browsersync](http://www.browsersync.io/). Helping you to stay productive
following the best practices. A solid starting point for both professionals
and newcomers to the industry.

### Getting Started

- Follow the [getting started guide](./docs/getting-started.md) to download and run the project
  ([Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) >= 6.9)
- Check the [code recipes](./docs/recipes) used in this boilerplate, or share yours

### Customization

The `master` branch of React Starter Kit doesn't include a Flux implementation or any other
advanced integrations. Nevertheless, we have some integrations available to you in _feature_
branches that you can use either as a reference or merge into your project:

- [feature/redux](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/redux) ([PR](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/pull/1084))
  — isomorphic Redux by [Pavel Lang](https://github.com/langpavel)
  (see [how to integrate Redux](./docs/recipes/how-to-integrate-redux.md)) (based on `master`)
- [feature/apollo](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/apollo) ([PR](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/pull/1147))
  — isomorphic Apollo Client by [Pavel Lang](https://github.com/langpavel)
  (see [Tracking PR #1147](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/pull/1147)) (based on `feature/redux`)
- [feature/react-intl](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/react-intl) ([PR](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/pull/1135))
  — isomorphic Redux and React Intl by [Pavel Lang](https://github.com/langpavel)
  (see [how to integrate React Intl](./docs/recipes/how-to-integrate-react-intl.md)) (based on `feature/apollo`)
- [feature/apollo-pure](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/tree/feature/apollo-pure) ([PR](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/pull/1664))
  — bare Apollo codebase by [piglovesyou](https://github.com/piglovesyou) (based on `master`)

You can see status of most reasonable merge combination as [PRs labeled as `TRACKING`](https://github.com/kriasoft/react-starter-kit/labels/TRACKING)

If you think that any of these features should be on `master`, or vice versa, some features should
removed from the `master` branch, please [let us know](https://gitter.im/kriasoft/react-starter-kit).
We love your feedback!
